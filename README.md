# Synergy Is Fun

A WIP mod for Cassette Beasts with the goal of adding more moves that offer synergistic tools and enable new playstyles.

## Stickers

All stickers from Synergy Is Fun! have the [SIF] prefix. You can find them in the same place as you would vanilla stickers - in sticker packs, merchants, and as loot drops. Additionally, a unique sticker pack containing only uncommon/rare SIF stickers can be bought for 50 metal at the Town Hall vending machine.

[A full list of current and planned moves can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PVAPvS1KH769mgNRmwgXxsUbR0ZPkDBSG3a3ASYxYGo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Set 1: Terra's Bounty

Contains 20 moves that synergize with Healing Leaf, Leeched and Plant Wall status effects. They are themed around nature, crops and healing.

- Build up and transfer Healing Leaf stacks with **Crop Rotation** and **Wild Growth**.
- Gain powerful but situational healing abilities from **Miracle Seed**, **Rumination**, and **Graze**.
- Amplify healing with **Fertile Soil** and **Greenhouse**, or turn them into AP with **Harvest Season**.
- Use Healing Leaf stacks to deal heavy damage with **Crop Raze** and **Controlled Burn**.
- Amass large stacks of Plant Walls with **Vine Whip**, **Growth Chemicals** and **Overgrowth**.
- Remove enemy Healing Leaf effects with **Chilling Gust**, **Weedkiller**, and **Shear Force**.
- Deliver a powerful combo with **What We Sow** and **What We Reap**.
- Leech your enemies and pick them clean with **Dandelion Puff** and **Pecked Clean**.

## NPC Battles

NPC battle cut for now due to issue with Mod Club Station.

~~There is currently one scripted NPC battle utilizing SIF stickers. They can be found in the **Mod Club Station** from Mod Utils. More NPCs and better integration into the game world may come in the future.~~

## Compatibility

Requires [Mod Utils](https://github.com/Yukitty/CassetteBeasts-modutils).

Safe to install and remove from existing saves - modded stickers will disappear if mod is removed.

Tested on Cassette Beasts v1.7 singleplayer. Currently untested on multiplayer, but is tagged appropriately and should function.
